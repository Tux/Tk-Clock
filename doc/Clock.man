[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       This module implements a Canvas-based clock widget for perl-Tk with
       lots of options to change the appearance.

       Both analog and digital clocks are implemented.

[1mMETHODS[0m
   [1mClock[0m
       This is the constructor. It does accept the standard widget options
       plus those described in "config".

   [1mconfig[0m
       Below is a description of the options/attributes currently available.
       Their default value is in between parenthesis.

       useAnalog (1)
       useInfo (0)
       useDigital (1)
           Enable the analog clock ("useAnalog") and/or the digital clock
           ("useDigital") in the widget. The analog clock will always be
           displayed above the digital part

             +----------+
             |    ..    |  \
             |  . \_ .  |   |_ Analog clock
             |  .    .  |   |
             |    ..    |  /
             | 23:59:59 |  --- Digital time
             | 31-12-09 |  --- Digital date
             +----------+

           The analog clock displays ticks, hour hand, minutes hand and second
           hand.  The digital part displays two parts, which are configurable.
           By default these are time and date.

           The "useInfo" enables a text field between the backdrop of the
           analog clock and its items. You can use this field to display
           personal data.

       autoScale (0)
           When set to a true value, the widget will try to re-scale itself to
           automatically fit the containing widget.

             $clock->config (autoScale => 1);

       anaScale (100)
           The analog clock can be enlarged or reduced using anaScale for
           which the default of 100% is about 72x72 pixels.

           When using "pack" for your geometry management, be sure to pass
           "-expand =&gt; 1, -fill =&gt; "both"" if you plan to resize with
           "anaScale" or enable/disable either analog or digital after the
           clock was displayed.

             $clock->config (anaScale => 400);

       ana24hour (0)
           The default for the analog clock it the normal 12 hours display, as
           most clocks are. This option will show a clock where one round of
           the hour-hand will cover a full day of 24 hours, noon is at the
           bottom where the 6 will normally display.

             $clock->config (ana24hour => 1);

       useSecHand (1)
           This controls weather the seconds-hand is shown.

             $clock->config (useSecHand => 0);

       countDown (0)
           When "countDown" is set to a true value, the clock will run
           backwards.  This is a slightly experimental feature, it will not
           count down to a specific point in time, but will simply reverse the
           rotation, making the analog clock run counterclockwise.

       timerValue (0)
           This represents a countdown timer.

           When setting "timerValue" to a number of seconds, the format values
           "Hc", "Mc", and "Sc" will represent the hour, minute and second of
           the this value. When the time reaches 0, all countdown values are
           reset to 0.

       localOffset (0)
           The value of this attribute represents the local offset for this
           clock in seconds. Negative is back in time, positive is in the
           future.

             # Wind back clock 4 days, 5 hours, 6 minutes and 7 seconds
             $clock->config (localOffset => -363967);

       handColor ("Green4")
       secsColor ("Green2")
           Set the color of the hands of the analog clock. "handColor"
           controls the color for both the hour-hand and the minute-hand.
           "secsColor" controls the color for the seconds-hand.

             $clock->config (
                 handColor => "#7F0000",
                 secsColor => "OrangeRed",
                 );

       handCenter (0)
           If set to a true value, will display a circular extension in the
           center of the analog clock that extends the hands as if they have a
           wider area at their turning point, like many station-type clocks
           (at least in the Netherlands) have.

             $clock->config (handCenter => 1);

       tickColor ("Yellow4")
           Controls the color of the ticks in the analog clock.

             $clock->config (tickColor => "White");

       tickFreq (1)
       tickDiff (0)
           "tickFreq" controls how many ticks are shown in the analog clock.

           Meaningful values for "tickFreq" are 1, 5 and 15 showing all ticks,
           tick every 5 minutes or the four main ticks only, though any
           positive integer will do (put a tick on any "tickFreq" minute).

           When setting tickDiff to a true value, the major ticks will use a
           thicker line than the minor ticks.

             $clock->config (
                 tickFreq => 5,
                 tickDiff => 1,
                 );

       timeZone ("")
           Set the timezone for the widget. The format should be the format
           recognized by the system. If unset, the local timezone is used.

             $clock->config (timeZone => "Europe/Amsterdam");
             $clock->config (timeZone => "MET-1METDST");

       useLocale ("C")
           Use this locale for the text shown in month formats "mmm" and
           "mmmm" and in day formats "ddd" and "dddd".

             $clock->config (useLocale => $ENV{LC_TIME} // $ENV{LC_ALL}
                                       // $ENV{LANG}    // "nl_NL.utf8");

           See <http://docs.moodle.org/dev/Table_of_locales> for a table of
           locales and the Windows equivalents. Windows might not have a UTF8
           version available of the required locale.

       timeFont ("fixed 6")
           Controls the font to be used for the top line in the digital clock.
           Will accept all fonts that are supported in your version of
           perl/Tk. This includes both True Type and X11 notation.

             $clock->config (timeFont => "{Liberation Mono} 11");

       timeColor ("Red4")
           Controls the color of the first line (time) of the digital clock.

             $clock->config (timeColor => "#00ff00");

       timeFormat ("HH:MM:SS")
           Defines the format of the first line of the digital clock. By
           default it will display the time in a 24-hour notation.

           Legal "timeFormat" characters are "H" and "HH" for 24-hour, "h" and
           "hh" for AM/PM hour, "M" and "MM" for minutes, "S" and "SS" for
           seconds, "Hc" for countdown/timer hour, "Mc" for countdown/timer
           minutes, "Sc" for countdown/timer seconds, "A" for AM/PM indicator,
           "d" and "dd" for day-of-the month, "ddd" and "dddd" for short and
           long weekday, "m", "mm", "mmm" and "mmmm" for month, "y" and "yy"
           for year, "w" and "ww" for week-number and any separators ":", "-",
           "/" or "space".

             $clock->config (timeFormat => "hh:MM A");

           The text shown in the formats "ddd", "dddd", "mmm", and "mmmm"
           might be influenced by the setting of "useLocale". The fallback is
           locale "C".

       dateFont ("fixed 6")
           Controls the font to be used for the bottom line in the digital
           clock. Will accept all fonts that are supported in your version of
           perl/Tk. This includes both True Type and X11 notation.

             $clock->config (dateFont => "-misc-fixed-*-normal--15-*-c-iso8859-1");

       dateColor ("Blue4")
           Controls the color of the second line (date) of the digital clock.

             $clock->config (dateColor => "Navy");

       dateFormat ("dd-mm-yy")
           Defines the format of the second line of the digital clock. By
           default it will display the date in three groups of two digits
           representing the day of the month, the month, and the last two
           digits of the year, separated by dashes.

             $clock->config (dateFormat => "ww dd-mm");

           The supported format is the same as for "timeFormat".

       infoFont ("fixed 6")
           Controls the font to be used for the info label in the analog
           clock. Will accept all fonts that are supported in your version of
           perl/Tk. This includes both True Type and X11 notation.

             $clock->config (infoFont => "{DejaVu Sans Mono} 8");

       infoColor ("#cfb53b")
           Controls the color of the info label of the analog clock (default
           is a shade of Gold).

             $clock->config (infoColor => "Yellow");

       infoFormat ("HH:MM:SS")
           Defines the format of the label inside the analog clock. By default
           will not be displayed. Just as "timeFormat" and "dateFormat" the
           content is updated every second if enabled.

             $clock->config (infoFormat => "BREITLING");

           The supported format is the same as for "timeFormat".

       digiAlign ("center")
           Controls the placement of the text in the digital clock. The only
           legal values for "digiAlign" are "left", "center", and "right".
           Any other value will be interpreted as the default "center".

             $clock->config (digiAlign => "right");

       backDrop ("")
           By default the background of the clock is controlled by the
           "-background" attribute to the constructor, which may default to
           the default background used in the perl/Tk script.

           The "backDrop" attribute accepts any valid Tk::Photo object, and it
           will show (part of) the image as a backdrop of the clock

             use Tk;
             use Tk::Clock;
             use Tk::Photo;
             use Tk::PNG;

             my $mainw = MainWindow->new;
             my $backd = $mainw->Photo (
                 -file    => "image.png",
                 );
             my $clock = $mainw->Clock (
                 -relief  => "flat",
                 )->pack (-expand => 1, -fill => "both");
             $clock->config (
                 backDrop => $backd,
                 );
             MainLoop;

       The "new ()" constructor will also accept options valid for Canvas
       widgets, like "-background" and "-relief".

[1mTAGS[0m
       As all of the clock is part of a Canvas, the items cannot be addressed
       as Subwidgets. You can however alter presentation afterwards using the
       tags:

        my $clock = $mw->Clock->pack;
        $clock->itemconfigure ("date", -fill => "Red");

       Currently defined tags are "date", "hour", "info", "min", "sec",
       "tick", and "time".

[1mBUGS[0m
       If the system load's too high, the clock might skip some seconds.

       There's no check if either format will fit in the given space.

[1mTODO[0m
       * Full support for multi-line date- and time-formats with auto-resize.
       * Countdown clock API, incl action when done.  * Better docs for the
       attributes
