Tk::Clock
    Clock widget for Perl/Tk with analog and/or digital display

DESCRIPTION
    A canvas clock widget with both analog and digital represen-
    tation of both time and date.

    It is highly configurable for as far as colors and fonts and
    the way time and date is displayed.

    The year is displayed in two digits  in the default configu-
    ration, which makes it not Y2K compliant.

PREREQUISITES
    perl5 (probably 5.004.04 or better)
    Tk (probably 400.xxx or better)

    This port was tested on several OS's with perl-5.8.8-dor,
    perl-5.8.7-dor, and perl-5.8.5-dor in 32bit and 64bit builds
    all with Tk-804.027.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
    As all CPAN modules:
	# perl Makefile.PL
	# make test
	# make install

    make test should run the clock with some changing contrasting
    colors showing the following configurations for 4 seconds each:
    	1. Both analog and digital clock,
    	2. Only analog clock,
    	3. Only digital clock,
    	4. Both analog- and digital clock using an american like
    	   time/date format (for wich I shouldn't actualy support
    	   formats, cause amaricans do often not support european
    	   formats, but I thought, I'd be nice for this time),
	5. Only digital clock with an empty time format and a
	   double line date format showing the day of the week
	   and the date.

BUGS
    Probably a few. One of them is that if you change the clock
    too often with ->config (), some elements might not be moved
    correctly, like getting a clock with 5 hands :)
